When testing web sites it's common that you have to interact with HTML to submit forms, extract
data, check for existence of elements or text etc.

For that reason k6 has the [Selection](/javascript-api/k6-html/selection) API. It contains more or less all
of the [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/) that makes sense in the context of k6.

There are also some higher level APIs to do specific things in a more compact way:

- [Working with HTML forms](/using-k6/html/working-with-html-forms)
