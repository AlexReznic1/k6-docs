        k6 users are typically Developers, QA Engineers, and DevOps. They use k6
        for testing the performance of APIs, microservices, and websites. Common
        k6 use cases are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Heading tag={'h3'} size={'md'} className={styles.title}>
            Load Testing
          </Heading>
          <p>
            k6 is optimized for minimal consumption of system resources. Itâ€™s a
            high-performance tool designed for running tests with high load. You
            can use it for running tests with a high load (spike, stress,
            endurance tests) in pre-production and QA environments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Heading tag={'h3'} size={'md'} className={styles.title}>
            Performance monitoring
          </Heading>
          <p>
            k6 provides great primitives for code modularization, performance
            thresholds, and automation. These features make it an excellent
            choice for performance monitoring. You could run tests with a small
            amount of load to continuously monitor the performance of your
            production environment.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
